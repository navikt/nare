NARE is a simple variation over the Specification pattern, as described by Eric Evans & Martin Fowler here: https://martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf.


The example implementation provided here evaluates a simplified version of the conditions for receiving "MÃ¸drekvote", a small subset of the overall parental leave.

The evaluation can be visualized in D3 too!
